One of my favorite things to listen to while driving is a good moving track.

Only because it centers me to believe that there's a rush of information coming.

I have yet to really find something that motivates me as well as a late night drive.

I think it's crazy how great music is able to transport you to different places. Specially
if there's a great sense of unity within all of the tracks.

But then again, maybe this isn't the right time to be blogging.
