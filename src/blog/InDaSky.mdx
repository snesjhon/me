I've been trying to consolidate all of my apps into using native Apple apps. I would lose part of the markdown functionality
but overall I don't see this as a bad thing. Mostly because the less I have to "keep up" with the less I have to really maintain. 

I'm excited that my SO is graduating from UI/UX bootcamp. I'm always weary as to the job prospects, but I'm excited for the future. The point is to keep moving forward. That's the challenge. Keep moving forward.
