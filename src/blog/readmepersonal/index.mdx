title: README.md as a Personal Site
date: 2018-12-18
---

After reading this article [Evolution of My Personal Site](https://dev.to/dstarner/evolution-of-my-personal-site-1849) I recalled how often I’d change my personal site as well. Most of the time I’d adopt a new framework with a new design. But I was always dissatisfied.

I found that by the time I’d setup the site, chosen a theme, figured out the workflow (not to mention wrangle all the dependencies) I’d already be disinterested with how I’d update this site continuously.

> I wanted something simpler.

Here are the requirements I was looking for:

- **Minimal setup**

  - I didn’t want to deal with components, routers, boilerplates.
  - Local dev workflows are nice, but it depends on how often you'd envision updating this site. For me, it wasn't very frequent.

- **Clean/Simple Theme**

  - I enjoy tinkering with themes, but I just wanted to manipulate a couple of simple css rules and be on my way.

- **Easy to publish -- Anywhere.**
  - Just push and publish. On my local or phone.

Most recently I'd gone through the personal site rabbit hole with GatsbyJS. Although it's a great package -- again, by the time I'd setup everything I'd given up on keeping up with the site.

_Sometimes too many options is not what everyone wants._

# Inspiration

While reading the [dev.to](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to) README.md I was struck with how pleasant it must've been to write it.

Not only was it clear, but it conveyed enough information to get the developer started.

So I figured there must be a way of just converting a simple README.md file to a full fledged website and just use that as my personal site. One caveat -- I wanted what I saw on the markdown to be the website. Not another theme or styling, just Github Flavored Markdown style.

_Welp. Not so simple._

# Github Pages, Gitlab Pages + showdown.js

Here are my current options when trying to convert a markdown to a personal site. (disclaimer: I'm not saying any of these services are bad -- they just didn't fit my use case)

**Github Pages**

- As detailed [here](https://blog.github.com/2016-12-09-publishing-with-github-pages-now-as-easy-as-1-2-3/), you're able to upload a markdown file and have that as a Github Page.

- However, Github Pages are closely tied with Jekyll Themes. They also add a title and header that aren't part of the markdown file. I had to use css to hide unwanted parts of the jekyll theme.

**Gitlab Pages + showdown.js**

- [Gitlab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/product/pages/) were another option as they have a commit & push pipeline runner. Which is great because I could utilize any markdown cli converter to publish an index.html.
- After searching on [many](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown), [many](https://pandoc.org/getting-started.html) converters I found that they were great when you wanted to output html -- but not a complete `index.html`. That makes sense as they were built to output to a surrounding framework.

### So why not just a simple `html` file?

As I learned from the @dstarner blog, sometimes it's best to keep it simple. I wrote up a simple index.html file, added GFM css, and was done!

But -- well -- have you tried to write html on your phone. It's not the most pleasant experience. Why can't I just write markdown?

# (Over)Engineering a Solution

I'm thoroughly convinced that 96.4% of all npm modules were written because someone couldn't solve their problem so they wrote it themself.

SO! I wrote a small cli to solve my problem.

I called it [singlemd](https://gitlab.com/snesjhon/singlemd) and it accomplishes exactly what I want wanted.

- Here's a [demo site](https://snesjhon.gitlab.io/singlemd/), and the [README.md](https://gitlab.com/snesjhon/singlemd/blob/master/README.md) source.

My website is now just a simple markdown file, which I can modify anywhere. And with Gitlab Pages pipeline I can add a `.gitlab-ci.yml`

```
image: node:8.12.0

pages:
  cache:
    paths:
    - node_modules/

  script:
  - npm install singlemd -g
  - singlemd --input ./README.md --output index.html --style ./public/style.css --title "snesjhon | Jhon Paredes"
  - mv index.html ./public
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - public
  only:
    - master
```

And anytime I update my README.md my website is updated. **FUN!**

- Here's my [personal site](https://snesjhon.com/) and the [repo](https://gitlab.com/snesjhon/snesjhon.gitlab.io)

### Lessons

This is the first npm package that I've published and I'm glad that it was something that I'm actively utilizing. Lots of work left to do, but overall a great experience learning how to create + publish a cli package.

Thank you for reading!
