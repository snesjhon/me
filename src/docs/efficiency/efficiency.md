## Gather context quickly

How do we best use AI to understand the "what/how/why" of our code?

<!-- It's important to understand that AI is not a silver bullet. It's a tool that can help us, but it's not a replacement for the skills and knowledge of a developer. It's fascinating to see that everything that can be generated by AI from top up. But I see it as a tool that is best served (at least at this moment) to help us be more efficient in the way that we understand the code, rather than the actual code generation. Although that's pretty cool too! -->

## Structured Prompt

```
Analyze the data flow in this file:
1. Entry: List all user interactions and API calls
2. State: Track how the data changes through each step
3. Dependencies: Map external service calls and component dependencies
4. Output: Show where data is rendered or sent
```

## GitBlame & History

Using Github CLI to get the commit history and blame in combination with Cursor.

<!--

git blame -L 728,753 packages/form-core/src/FormApi.ts | \
while read -r line; do
  sha=$(echo $line | awk '{print $1}')
  {
    echo "$line"
    echo "PR Info for $sha:"
    gh pr list --search "$sha" --state merged --json number,title,body --jq '.[] | "PR #\(.number): \(.title)\nDescription: \(.body)\n"'
    echo "-------------------"
  }
done | pbcopy

-->

## Hype Cycle

<!-- So maybe you've tried or have been meaning to try to use AI to help you write code, but you've been hesitant or dissapointed with the results -->

> We become better engineers by embracing and furthering technology, moving ourselves up the stack of abstraction, allowing us to become far more productive than we ever thought possible. We need to be _optimistic_ about the future of technology, not _cynical_. There is no better time to be alive.
