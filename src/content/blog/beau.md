Something about Beau is Afraid makes me wonder about my experience living through life.

What are things that I might've seen in a different way, things that I experienced that weren't as "immediate" as they were.

But overall, I think it made me realize that things around me aren't always just as they are, maybe it's just all
how we perceive it in my head. Or maybe I don't want to face the theater around me.
