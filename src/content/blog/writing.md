I think writing is very important, but for me its always been difficult.

A mentor of mine told me that "Writing can be like code", in a sense that you're trying to convince
a machine to understand your code in clean and concise way.

Why wouldn't writing be the same. You're layout this "code" to create a way of convincing your
reader about your argument.
