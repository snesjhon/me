I've been itching to do some live coding. I know that my machine isn't powerful enough and there's a
lot of choppiness in the video. But overall I'm happy with the result. I can see my though process
coming together to get a certain feature through.

In some sense I'm relieved that I am able to hold myself accountable to creating certain things without
certain distractions. I know myself enough that I'll lag and won't be able to completely focus
on a single thing. But live coding (even if no one is watching lol) is me holding myself to the
standard of making sure that if the future-me watches, I'll be okay in following my thought process.

> At least I hope so.
