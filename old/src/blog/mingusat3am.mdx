One of my favorite things to listen to while driving is a good moving track. Only because it centers me to believe that there's a rush of information coming.
I have yet to really find something that motivates me as well as a late night drive. I think it's crazy how great music is able to transport you to different places. Specially if there's a great sense of unity within all of the tracks.

But then again, maybe this isn't the right time to be blogging.

I created a new blog because I wanted to express where I was at in terms of goals. But also have a
more direct way of bloggin without relying on [DEV](https://dev.to/snesjhon/). Although I think it's a
great platform to blog in, I only want to blog about tech information. (I am aware of the
#watercooler tag).

Another thing I realized this week is that although I really like the idea
React Hooks, I'm not all the way sold yet. I think it's good to reduce
redundancy in your code, but at the same time it doesn't make sure to
overtly complicate it just to "think" in a different way. I'm not saying that
they're not helpful. In fact, I think the React Team realized that they _are_
helpful, but not all the way necessary in all scenarios.

`Class`es are harder for the compiler to comprehend, but at the same time,
isn't the engineer more on the hook (heh), to try to make sense of the code.
Sure it's not necessarily more _easy_ to comprehend, but at least there's more
of a "cycle" to reason through as opposed to figuring out why a state
has been affected based on the scenario that the hooks compiler has ended up
deciding to...compile to.

Again, this is not a slight passive aggresive nit at Hooks, but rather my
general experience. But again, that could be my ultimate blind-side.

Maybe changing something that's already ingrained and constructed (with Redux)
isn't the best scenario to be in. I'm sure that as I get more comfortable with
Hooks I'll come back to this post and start realizing my blind spots.

Or maybe I'll try svelte or vue ... lol.
